// Use export to Share a Code Block
/* If there were a file called math_functions.js 
containing a function called add, it could be exported like this: */

// export const add = (x, y) => {
//     return x + y;
// }

// The above could also be written:
const add = (x, y) => {
    return x + y;
}

export { add };
