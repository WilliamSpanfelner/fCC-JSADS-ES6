// Create a JavaScript Promise
/* A promise is used to do something, usually asynchronously, 
when a task completes.  The new keyword is required when using
promise as it is a constructor function. The constructor takes 
two parameters resolve and reject. The syntax is as follows:
*/
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

});

/* Create a new promise called makeServerRequest. Pass in a 
function with resolve and reject parameters to the constructor. */
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    
});
